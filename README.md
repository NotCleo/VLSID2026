# VLSID2026


1) We're flashing the board with a SSD, which will be loaded with the Ubuntu(RV variant) - ubuntu-24.04.3-preinstalled-server-riscv64+icicle.img.xz

2) We needed a SSD card and it's reader to do so....

3) How to check my laptop's MAC/IP and what ports are active, and what's my ethernet port and is it active or not? How do I check if the Icicle Kit to which I have SSH access into is communicating with my laptop or not via the ethernet? How do I check the same things for the board too?

4) Refer the BootProcess.png for how to switch between eMMC and the SSD

5)
