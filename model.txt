To create a calibration dataset for post-training quantization (PTQ), select a small, representative subset of your training or validation data (around 100â€“500 samples) to run through the model. This dataset is used to collect statistics on the model's internal activations, which are then used to determine the optimal quantization parameters (like minimum and maximum ranges for each tensor) for mapping floating-point values to a lower-precision integer format. The dataset should be unlabeled, and its purpose is to capture the typical range of activation values to ensure accuracy is maintained after quantization.
